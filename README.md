# Cursor AI Telemetry Modifier

### Disclaimer:

## Description

The Cursor AI Telemetry Modifier is a Python-based script that anonymizes telemetry data by replacing existing identifiers with random UUID-based values. It is designed to modify the `storage.json` file for Cursor AI in a user-friendly and privacy-conscious manner.

---

## Features

- **Telemetry Anonymization**: Replaces telemetry-related fields with randomly generated UUID-based values.
- **ASCII Art Header**: Displays "CURSOR AI" in ASCII art for an enhanced user experience.
- **JSON File Handling**: Reads, modifies, and saves JSON data with comprehensive error handling.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear and actionable messages for every operation.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure the following:

1. **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.
2. Required Python libraries are installed:
   - `pyfiglet`: Install using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install pyfiglet
     ```
   - Built-in libraries `json` and `uuid`.

---

## Usage

### Running the Script

1. Open the script file and update the `json_file_path` variable with the full path to your `storage.json` file:
   ```python
   json_file_path = r'C:\\Users\\YourName\\AppData\\Roaming\\Cursor\\User\\globalStorage\\storage.json'
Run the script in your terminal:

bash
Always show details

Copy code
python cursor_ai_telemetry_modifier.py
The script will:

Generate and display ASCII art for "CURSOR AI".
Replace telemetry-related fields in the JSON file with random UUID values.
Save the updated data back to the JSON file and display a success message.
Error Handling
The script includes error handling for the following scenarios:

File Not Found: Displays an error message if the specified storage.json file is missing.
Invalid JSON: Notifies the user if the JSON file content cannot be decoded due to formatting issues.
